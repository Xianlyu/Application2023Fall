*Note: RL=recommendation letter;  HKT=Hong Kong Time;  BJT=Beijing Time; PST=Pacific Standard Time*



I finally plan to apply to **14** programs, but **only 11 RLs** are needed. You will complete all RLs electronically.



I summarized the RL requirements of different programs here:

- speak to  the applicant's <font color=blue>academic, professional, and/or personal </font> <font color=brown>character, strengths, abilities, and potential</font> to succeed as a graduate student
- Earliest DDL: (HKT / BJT ) **Dec 1, 2022 1:00 pm**

------



The first 4 programs share **one** common RL. 



You will receive an email with a link to [Letters by Liaison](https://help.liaisonedu.com/Letters_by_Liaison_Help_Center) (a  recommender portal) to submit the RL. 



You may need to answer <font color=brown>some questions</font> + <font color=blue>provide some ratings</font> + <font color=brown>select an overall recommendation from a drop-down</font> + <font color=blue>upload letter</font>.
